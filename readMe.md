## Switch Scene

Forked from [Fun Scene](https://github.com/ipadkid358/funscene), Switch Scene demonstrates moving a SCNScene between an ARSCNView and a SCNView

This exmaple app switches between the two view types with a toggle, and allows the user to change the color of the SCNNode to prove the scene state doesn't reset while switching
